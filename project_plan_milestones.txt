Current status (Date: 2025-03-30)
	The core structure done with CurveManager, ScenarioManager, SecurityManager and TaskDispatcher
	- only the basic bond as instrument
	- only SimpleCurve is defined and loadable: to add a generic instrument loader
	
TODO
	next milestone 1: collect curve related codes into a curve folder?
	done:
		1. keep CurveManager in the root folder but move all curve classes to the curves folder
	todo:
		2. add Cashlike, swap legs, and swaps for which implement cashflows and indexes
		3. add holiday schedules, but only use its basic functions so Cashlike and Swap can be stub-implemented. 
		4. how to connect curve instrument to underlying securities? Add Cashlike and Swap instruments to experiment
	
	next milestone 2: bootstrap a basic swap curve with Cashlike and IR Swaps
	3. add scheduler
	4. add swaps and Cashlike to a curve definition and create the generic instrument loader
